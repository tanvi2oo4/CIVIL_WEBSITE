        <h3>ADVANCED PAVEMENT SYSTEMS LABORATORY</h3>
        <p>
            Currently, the Advanced Pavement Systems (APS) laboratory at IITT is
             housed inside of a state-of-the-art sustainable building in 
             permanent campus under the larger aegis of the Materials for
              sustainability, Asset management, & Performance monitoring 
              of Smart infrastructure (MAPSmart) Research Cluster. The equipment
               housed in this laboratory allows for undergraduate teaching as 
               well as postgraduate and doctoral research activities in the
                areas of sustainable transportation infrastructure as well as 
                pavements / materials. The APS laboratory is adjacent to the 
                geotechnical laboratory, structural mechanics laboratory,
                 concrete materials laboratory, environmental engineering 
                 laboratory, and water resources laboratory, which together 
                 provide for comprehensive study of sustainable infrastructure
                  engineering. Note that the APS laboratory at IITT is being 
                  created as one of the best and most advanced research and 
                  teaching facilities in India, and currently occupies about 
                  1000 square feet of space. Further, additional laboratory 
                  facilities covering an area of over 40000 square feet are 
                  also being created on-campus IITT through the Ministry of 
                  Road Transport & Highways sponsored research grants. The APS 
                  laboratory is capable of full characterization of unbound 
                  materials, asphalt binder as well as asphalt concrete and 
                  cement concrete mixtures. Transportation pavement / materials
                   engineering research program at IITT addresses advanced 
                   pavement materials testing, performance analysis, design and
                    management, development of novel and smart materials as well 
                    as establishment of sustainable construction practices. The 
                    current program consists of undergraduate and postgraduate 
                    research, including doctoral studies.
        </p><br>
        <p>It is envisioned that the APS laboratory will provide a venue where pavement 
            engineers, scientists, researchers, technical experts, and students of partnering
             institutions can share information on topics that further advance sustainability
              of pavement networks in a comprehensive manner. This platform would encompass
               the global effort of understanding pavement sustainability, including general
                theories and models, which aid in understanding the decision-making processes 
                and policies. Furthermore, the APS laboratory will promote fundamental research
                 in transportation pavement infrastructure engineering to advanced design and 
                 analyses of alternative roadway construction materials and technologies that
                  focus on “quality of life” issues to create greener sustainable cities on a 
                  global scale. The research activities of the APS 
            laboratory are geared to help transfer of technology in various research topics,
             but not limited to: (a) innovations in new/modified pavement materials and 
             innovative technologies, (b) accelerated pavement testing, (c) climate 
             impacts and environmental issues, (d) energy conservation and CO2 emissions, 
             (e) tire / pavement noise, (f) Urban Heat Island, and (g) tire wear emissions.</p>
